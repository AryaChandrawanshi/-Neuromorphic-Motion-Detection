# -Neuromorphic-Motion-Detection
This project implements a neuromorphic gesture-recognition pipeline using the DVS128 event-based sensor dataset. Instead of traditional frame-based vision, the system processes asynchronous spike events, enabling faster and low-power motion detection suitable for edge devices.
